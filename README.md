Tandy 1000/1000A/1000SX keyboard converter by Adrian Black

Version 0.2 20-SEP-2020

Parts needed:
- Arduino Pro Mini or any other Atmel ATMEGA 168/368 board
- Arduino IDE
- PS2 or AT Keyboard
- DIN 5 Female and DIN 8 or Din 5 Male
- Some wire

Requires Arduino Library: https://github.com/techpaul/PS2KeyRaw by Paul Carpenter

Converts from AT/PS2 keyboard _TO_ the Tandy 1000 so you can use a regular keyboard with a Tandy 1000! Should work on the Tandy 1000, 1000A, 1000SX and possibly others that use the original Tandy Keyboard. 

Power provided by the Tandy so you can create a cable with the Arduino in the middle. 

A standard 5 pin DIN extension cable is all you need to make this work or ideally you can make your own cable using a DIN 8 on the Tandy side and either a PS2 female or a DIN-5 Female (AT keyboard) connector.

**Warning:** it's possible to insert the DIN 5 into the Tandy turned one or more pins! Make sure you have the center notch on the DIN-5 facing straight up -- or use the proper DIN cable to prevent this issue!

Verified scancodes using scope but they are all listed in the Tandy 1000 (original) Technical manual (page 106-107)

Todo: 
- Handle the Pause key
- Handle the Print Screen key
- Get the CAPS/NUM/SCROLL LED working

(I am ignoring the Reset and Busy line. The machine seems to work perfectly without them.)
